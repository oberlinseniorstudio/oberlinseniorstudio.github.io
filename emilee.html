		   <p> Work in progress update! I've been inspired by fall leaves, especially since they tie so well into my themes of change and time. I decided to watercolor a bunch of them, then scan them in and print them out double sided. I will be putting words on them that were sourced from the opinions of Oberlin students via a google form that I made (see below). I'm still exploring how to put on those words and how the leaves will be displayed (in book form, hanging from the ceiling?). </p>

<p>
Since the beginning of the semester, I have been working with themes of the passage of time, choice, and fear of change. I decided to work with those themes because for several months, they have been the main issues that have been on my mind in general. I wanted to work through these issues in my art, and I felt that as a college senior, those are feelings that many of my peers have been struggling with as well. I started my work for the year by making this book. I decided that it would be without text, and just tell its story through images. Here are some photos of the outside and a few of the pages.
