<b> 12/21/2018 </b>

I use sewing, cutting, sawing, hammering, to alter and reconfigure recycled textiles and carpets. I think of my practice as building or constructing. By altering domestic objects and materials, my art evokes memories of familiar spaces and the home. 


I explore textiles as holders and vessels for recollection and memory. I am inspired by family stories rooted in places both familiar and distant to me. I am fascinated by these stories and memories that feel somehow removed from my reality; I want to experience and explore them through the physical act of piecing together. I want my work to conjure memory for the viewer and past recollections. These stories, no matter how mundane, seem monumental to me, and worth documenting and reconstructing. 


I study used materials such as grimy rugs and old flooring that readily present the passage of time. Objects of the home map movement, space, and hold with them memories and connotations. I am concerned with the meaning and weight that these things hold, and drawing them out.
