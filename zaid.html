 A work I made for the show Alex and I organized in our house a couple of weeks ago. It consists of a green transparency sheet inside a window affecting the light entering the room. The first two photos show the piece in the day, allowing natural light to come through it, and the second two show it at night with the aid of an artificial light. The work is one in a series of sketches responding to historical claims on site  (the production and modulation of).

The Sociologist Olav Velthuis on the art commodity. Velthuis speculates that people hate art flippers so much because its against the norm of art as a product that’s commodification is relatively restricted. The opening of a show as the ritualization of art becoming commodity. The most valuable pieces do not really come from the old masters because those are mostly in permanent collections, Velthuis calls them “terminal commodities.” All the most expensive art pieces are between 1890 and 1970 and are quite large. The acronym BRIC refers to the fastest market growing economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China.
