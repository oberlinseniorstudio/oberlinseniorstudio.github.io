		  When I was little, I read a picture book called Miss Rumphius. The book is about a woman, Miss Rumphius, whose three goals in life are as follows: travel to faraway places, live in a house by the sea, and, at her grandfather’s encouragement, make the world a more beautiful place. I don’t care much for travel or the sea, but the part about making the world more beautiful stuck with me. Miss Rumphius makes the world more beautiful by planting lupine flowers everywhere she can, but I want to achieve that goal by making art. Life can often feel extremely meaningless, but beauty is just so universally appealing and meaningful, so I want to add more beauty to the world. 
This is why my work is so rooted in aesthetics. However, as a graphic designer, I know that aesthetics are useless if no meaning is conveyed. I’m familiar with the conventional ways of conveying meaning—text, imagery, color—but as an artist, I convey meaning using emotional and aesthetic tools as well. I’m interested in the ways that graphics can be literally illegible but still emotionally legible. 
Lately, I’ve been thinking about the impermanence of life, existentialism, and futility. These questions have been floating around in my head for at least a decade, but were thrown in sharper contrast this summer after the death of my aunt, Andrea. Like me, Andrea was obsessive. However, she didn’t seem to accomplish basically anything in her life that she wanted to accomplish. When she died she left us with an apartment to sort through that she had spent her entire life trying and failing to organize. The aftermath of her death—the sorting of objects, meeting her friends who we had never even heard of, hearing stories about her life that seemed distant from the person we knew her to be—it all made me think about legacy, about what happens to us after we die. My work literally asks existential questions, and by existing and being seen it answers them as well. 
I’m also attempting to recognize love as the cure for existentialism. I often feel like everything in life is futile because we’re going to die and then everyone who has ever met us will also die. This leads me to existential despair, for which there is no practical cure. Thus, I’m forced to look for impractical cures, such as being in love. Being really truly in love makes me feel like life is bigger than I can understand, and I’m less scared to die. I want my work to celebrate the people I love, I want my work to shout the love I feel, I want seeing my work to feel like being in love.
